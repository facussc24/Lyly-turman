# Lyly Turman

This project is a simple static site using HTML, Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript. It contains placeholder sections for a hero banner, artists, events, gallery, testimonials and contact information.

## Build and Run Instructions

No build step is required. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the site.

For local development you can use a lightweight server to serve the files. Examples:

```bash
# Using Python
python3 -m http.server

# Using Node (requires http-server installed)
npx http-server
```

Then navigate to the displayed local address, typically `http://localhost:8000`.
